# Cost policy (hard constraint — read before doing anything)

**We do not pay for any additional cost, under any circumstance, without explicit prior approval from the user.**

This applies to all three repos in this project (`evexec`, `evexecoperator`, `evexecdriverapp`) and to the shared Supabase project (`yoltkmhtxwluqxxpewbl`) they all depend on.

- **No new billed resources, ever, without asking first.** This includes (not an exhaustive list): Supabase database branches, additional Supabase projects, upgraded Supabase/Vercel plan tiers or add-ons, new paid third-party APIs or SaaS tools, additional cloud compute, paid monitoring/observability tiers, domain purchases, etc.
- **Twilio SMS is dormant (user decision, 2026-10-03).** All Twilio sending (SMS, WhatsApp, voice) across the three repos is gated behind an `SMS_ENABLED=true` env var / Supabase secret, which is unset, so nothing is sent or billed. Customer updates are now sent manually from the driver's or operator's own phone via pre-filled `sms:` links. Do not set `SMS_ENABLED`, remove the gate, or add new Twilio-sending flows without explicit approval.
- **Before taking any action that would create a new billed resource or increase spend on an existing one, stop and ask.** This applies even to trivially small amounts (pennies, hourly micro-charges) — the rule is "always ask first," not "ask only above some threshold."
- **Prefer free tiers and already-provisioned infrastructure.** When a task could be done either by spinning up a paid resource (e.g. a Supabase branch to test a migration) or by a slower/more careful free alternative (e.g. read-only validation queries plus additive, reversible migrations applied directly, with review), default to the free alternative unless the user has explicitly approved the paid one.
- Abandon or redesign any plan that turns out to require a new cost, rather than proceeding and asking forgiveness after the fact.
